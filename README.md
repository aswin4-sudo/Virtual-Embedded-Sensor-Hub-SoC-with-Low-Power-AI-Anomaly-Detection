 Virtual Embedded Sensor Hub SoC with Low Power AI Anomaly Detection

This project simulates a Virtual Embedded Sensor Hub System-on-Chip (SoC) integrated with AI-based anomaly detection, targeting industrial machinery, wearable health devices, satellite systems, and smart environmental monitors ‚Äî where low power and intelligent monitoring are essential.


# Project Aim

To design and simulate a low-power embedded system that can:

Continuously monitor sensor signals,

Detect anomalies using machine learning trained on normal data,

Minimize power consumption via FSM-controlled logic,

Trigger UART alerts during abnormal conditions,

Enable future deployment on microcontrollers, FPGAs, or real hardware.


# Real-World Implementation Vision

This simulated project represents the logic and behavior of a real embedded device that would operate in the following environments:

# Application	Functionality

1 Satellites	Detect temperature or radiation anomalies in orbit
2 Industrial Machines	Identify early mechanical or thermal failure signs
3 Wearables (e.g., smartwatches)	Monitor health vitals (e.g., heartbeat, oxygen level)
4 Smart Water Systems	Detect sudden pollution, chemical leakage, or turbidity rise


# In real devices:

The FSM logic would run on a microcontroller (e.g., STM32, ESP32).

The ML inference would be optimized using TinyML (TensorFlow Lite) or via co-processor.

UART output would be used to communicate with a display, logger, or cloud module (e.g., ESP32 Wi-Fi).

üõ†Ô∏è Features

‚úÖ Dataset simulating 1-day of sensor readings (1000+ entries)
‚úÖ Python ML model trained on normal patterns to identify outliers
‚úÖ FSM in Verilog HDL to model low-power state transitions
‚úÖ Sleep Mode to reduce energy usage when idle
‚úÖ UART output for alert signaling (ASCII: '0', '1', 'A')
‚úÖ AI output text file used as input to FSM testbench
‚úÖ Designed for real hardware translation (FPGA/MCU)



üîã Power-Aware FSM Logic

Your FSM smartly manages power depending on system state:

State	Role	Sensor	Power Usage	UART Output

SLEEP	Idle / no data	Disabled	üîã Very Low	'0'
ACTIVE	Normal pattern	Enabled	üîã Moderate	'1'
ALERT	Anomaly detected	Disabled	üîã Brief High	'A'


Entering sleep avoids wasting energy.

Anomalies are prioritized with fast transitions and alert flags.

UART acts as communication channel for external systems.



üìä AI Model Overview

Trained on sensor data representing 24 hours of normal behavior

Uses sklearn Isolation Forest / Logistic Regression to detect outliers

Output:

0: Normal

1: Anomaly

2: No sensor data


Saved as ai_output.txt ‚Üí read into Verilog testbench for FSM simulation


# Integration Flow (Python ‚Üî Verilog)

1. Python script generates simulated sensor data


2. ML model predicts anomalies and saves output to ai_output.txt


3. Verilog testbench reads this file in ModelSim


4. FSM updates state and sends UART output accordingly


5. Real devices can later use this logic with minimal changes
